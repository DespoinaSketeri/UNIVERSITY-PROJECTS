To model with a discrete-time SIR epidemiological model the spread of the corona pandemic in our country. To theoretically explain the role of the disease reproduction factor Ro. Assume that we are interested in studying the evolution of the disease in the Greek area. The disease starts with 10% of the population being infected due to travel abroad, and is transmitted at a high rate of transmission, which if no measures are taken will lead to the infection of 80% of the population in a month, while if transmission is completely reduced ( lockdown) the infection will disappear in 10 days. (a) Do a discrete-time simulation with your own code in MATLAB. Use a time interval between successive repetitions of one day. Hint: Assume deletion coefficient Î³=0.4 and find the infection rate from the above data. (b) If we don't want more than 50% of the population to be infected until the disease is gone, what instruction would you give to infectious disease experts regarding a possible lockdown? What would be the minimum time period you would recommend? (c) To depict the variables S(t),I(t),R(t),Ro(t) graphically for a period of 50 days from the beginning of the study, for three cases, (i) without lockdown, ( ii) with a lockdown from the first day, and (iii) a lockdown from the proposed day of question (b).
